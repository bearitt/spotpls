A command line interface written in Python that searches for tracks in Spotify playlists

**note: for full functionality, create a *secrets.py* file with the following information: **

client_id = {obtain by creating new app at the [Spotify developer page](https://developer.spotify.com)}
client_secret = {same as above}
oauth_token = {searching for a sexy way to do this. For now, go to https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-playlists/ and check off _playlist-read-private_ and _playlist-read-collaborative_ to access all playlists associated with your profile}
user_id = {your Spotify user id}
